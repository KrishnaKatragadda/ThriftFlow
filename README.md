# ThriftFlow
A Cross language Log Ingestion and evolvable Pipeline

🚀 Thrift-Based Logging System
This project demonstrates how to build a simple, language-agnostic logging system using Apache Thrift. It showcases:

🔁 Cross-language communication (e.g., Python client → Java server)

📦 Serialization via multiple protocols (Binary, JSON, Compact)

⚙️ Schema evolution with backward and forward compatibility

📊 Log streaming from microservices (clients) to a centralized collector (server)
